Using SciKit and its Non-Negative Metrix Factorization (NMF) , TfidfVectorizer tools 
Topic Modeling is a methode to analyse lage volume of data and cluster them into 'Topics'
We use Unsupervised Learning approch since we are working with Unlabled data and there is no 'right answer'
The model goes thourgh large volume of data and gives out the most probable words that may belong to the same topic 


NOTE# - The User decides the number of topics/clusters to be detected 
      - The User have to get what the topic is based on the most probable words 
      - Data use to train the model is a .csv file inside nrp.rar
